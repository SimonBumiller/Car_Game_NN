# Controlling a Unity car-game using neural networks & evolutionary processes
## Inspiration
This project was highly inspired and influenced by ['Samuel Arzt - Applying Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks'](https://github.com/ArztSamuel/Applying_EANNs).

Single files, design choices and ideas have been copied, modified and taken from that repository.

## Intention
This project was though as an introduction for myself, and for others to the topic of artificial intelligence in its' simplest form.

## Roadmap
- Feeding current speed and turn into the NN as inputs.
- Displaying the current speed and acceleration for the user.
- Better looking graphics, potentially 3 dimensional perspective.
- Menu for saving and loading generations/genotypes.
- Menu for manipulating the evolutionary process (selection, crossover and mutation) ingame.
- Menu for toggling the visuals of the cars (sensor and sensor crosses).

## Libraries (As of April 2023)
- [BezierCurveLines](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/bezier-curve-editor-11278) for drawing the smooth tracks.
