# Autonomous cars using Neural Networks and Evolutionary Algorithms
Welcome to this github page. This is the code and presentation materials used in my GFS in the 12th grade in Biology. The Purpose was to show how Biology and Computer Science can be combined.
## Resources
This animated video gives a simple introduction to what happens in the simulation:

For further explanation on what happens, you can take a look at the [slides](Documentation/Pr√§sentation.pdf).

# End result
The simulation was made in Unity using C# to visualize the progress. 

This video shows the first generation of cars:

This video shows the cars in the 20th generation:

## Inspiration
This project was highly inspired and influenced by ['Samuel Arzt - Applying Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks'](https://github.com/ArztSamuel/Applying_EANNs).
Single files, design choices and ideas have been copied, modified and taken from that repository.

## Intention
This project was though as an introduction for myself, and for others to the topic of artificial intelligence in its' simplest form.

## Roadmap
- Feeding current speed and turn into the NN as inputs.
- Displaying the current speed and acceleration for the user.
- Better looking graphics, potentially 3 dimensional perspective.
- Menu for saving and loading generations/genotypes.
- Menu for manipulating the evolutionary process (selection, crossover and mutation) ingame.
- Menu for toggling the visuals of the cars (sensor and sensor crosses).
